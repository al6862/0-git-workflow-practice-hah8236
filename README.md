# Article Title

I find it interesting to read about how software engineering can be used in industries that are not usually thought to be that related to tech. Like many others, I have always been intrigued by the idea of working somewhere within the entertainment industry. 

The article itself does feel partially like a promotion for the NYU Tisch and Billboard course on the music industry, which is a bit funny.
